Hello! 👋 I’m Jennifer, but you can call me Jen!

I'm a sales pro turned <b>software engineer</b> who loves coding and bringing creative ideas to life.

I’m currently a ⭐<b>Teaching Assistant (Software Engineering)</b>⭐ at BrainStation, where I help students navigate their coding journey in an intensive 3-month program. The best part? Connecting with students, chatting about code, and learning through a LOT of code reviews!

Alright, now let’s dive into a menu full of fun! 🍴✨
